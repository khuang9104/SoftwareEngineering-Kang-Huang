The backgammon gameboard UI design and UI display function are nearly done. Waiting for the Bar class and BearOffCalculator class to complete the entire UI component (UI version.1.0).

Basic input and output component added and tested. Prompts feature works well.

Entering the “roll” command should cause the result of a two dice roll to displayed on the board panel and reported in the log panel. The dice should be generated randomly. (Done.
