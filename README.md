Oct.21.2022 Kang:<br>
The backgammon gameboard UI design and UI display function are nearly done. Waiting for the Bar class and BearOffCalculator class to complete the entire UI component (UI version.1.0). 
   
#### 2. A feature that prompts the players to enter their names. Their names should be used in later prompts.


#### 3. A feature that allows the players to take turns rolling the dice. The players should be prompted to enter a command. Entering the “roll” command should cause the result of a two dice roll to displayed on the board panel and reported in the log panel. The dice should be generated randomly.


#### 4. A feature whereby a “quit” command causes termination of the program.
